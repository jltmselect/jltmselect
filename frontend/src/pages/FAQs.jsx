                Auctions: When you win a bid, you will be required to log in and pay for your winning. If you do not pay within 24 hours of your winning you will forfeit your win. All payments are processed securely through Stripe.`

            {
                question: "How do auctions work?",
                answer: "Every week we will have multiple hand-picked furniture and accessory pieces up for bid. All items up for bid start at a bid price of 95 - 85% off MSRP. The highest bidder prior to the bid closing wins the auction. Upon winning the bid, you must log back in and pay for your item. All items up for bid can be viewed in person at our showroom in Costa Mesa, California. All items must be picked up at the Costa Mesa showroom. We do not ship items."
            },
            {
                question: "Can I bid multiple times?",
                answer: "Yes! You can place as many bids as you'd like on any auction. The highest bidder wins. Check back often to ensure you are the highest bidder, or bid the highest amount you are willing to pay to improve your chances of winning."
            },
            {
                question: "What happens if I'm outbid?",

            },
            {
                question: "How is payment handled after winning?",
                answer: "The winning bidder will be notified to make payment within 8 hours. If payment is not received within this timeframe, you will lose the auction and this may lead to account suspension."
            },
            {
                question: "Can my auction-winning item be shipped to me?",
